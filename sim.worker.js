// The thread the simulation runs on, and no longer the thread the picture is
// drawn on.
//
// `construct`, `step`, the task table, the runner's records, the input queue,
// the recorder and the clock all live here; the page keeps the canvas ELEMENT
// and its CSS box, the audio context, the listeners, the halt table and the
// store; and `render_video` runs a thread further out, in `render.worker.js`,
// on a second instance of the module this one posts descriptions to. THIS
// THREAD OWNS NO CANVAS AND HAS NO DRAWING PATH AT ALL - not a fallback, not a
// first frame - which answers the third question of `madhousearcade`'s
// `docs/archived/render-worker-plan.md`: one path is what lets this tree say
// what a frame is, and a fallback nothing exercises is a fallback that rots.
//
// It exists for the three things a main-thread loop cannot do. A `step` that
// never returns wedges the page with nothing able to say so, and here it wedges
// a thread the page can terminate and report on - pending item 10 of
// `madhousearcade`'s `docs/decisions.md` - and `Watchdog` in `player.js` is the
// page's half of it: this thread posts a frame message per display frame, and
// their absence is what the page reads as a hang. A main thread stalled by
// layout, a collection or an extension stalls the simulation with it; here it
// does not, and neither the sound nor the picture has a producer on that path.
//
// WHAT THE PICTURE MOVING OUT COSTS is one display frame, and it is paid rather
// than avoided: a description posted from here is drawn on the next turn of
// another thread's event loop, which measured about 26 ms from publish to
// pixels against 8.84 ms for drawing here. What it buys is that a renderer that
// never returns wedges a RENDERER. `madhousearcade`'s
// `docs/archived/render-worker-plan.md` argues the trade and has every figure.
//
// THE CLOCK IS THE DISPLAY'S AND THE DISPLAY IS READ ON THE PAGE. The page's own
// animation frame posts its timestamp here as a `tick`, and this thread runs
// `Clock` on the number it is handed - so there is still nothing to estimate and
// no model to be wrong, and this thread asks the browser for nothing at all. It
// used to ask for its own animation frames, on a reading that a worker's
// callback IS the vsync. That reading was Chrome's: a Safari worker's callbacks
// are scattered across the refresh period at a circular concentration of 0.147
// against a uniform null of 0.097, where Chrome's worker reads 0.985, so the
// thread that stepped was reading a clock that was not the display's however
// close its RATE came. `madhousearcade`'s `docs/runs/frame-cadence-run.md` at
// `3f4fdb8d`, section 8, is the phase reading, section 16 is what it looks
// like, and section 19 is why `step` stayed on this thread rather than
// following the clock to the page. A page's callback is the display's in both
// browsers, and the page is the only thread on which that is known to be true.
//
// SO THE TIMESTAMP ARRIVES ALREADY ON THE PAGE'S ZERO, and this thread must not
// move it. That zero is the one the input queue is stamped in - every event
// carries the browser's own `event.timeStamp` and `Clock` drains the queue up to
// the boundary its timestamps put it at - and a dedicated worker's time origin
// is its own creation rather than the document's, so a clock run on this
// thread's zero held every press for however long the page took to fetch a
// module. Measured on the shipped page before that was fixed: press to the
// record's arrival read 14.2 ms on one load and 58.5 ms on the next, against
// 29.5 for the page that posted its own timestamps. This file used to subtract
// the two origins for exactly that and no longer has either number to subtract;
// a subtraction here now would move a page timestamp twice.
//
// The display is not the simulation's rate: `madhousearcade`'s
// `docs/runs/drawing-worker-run.md` read one panel at 120 Hz and at 60, so a
// tick steps whatever the accumulator says, which is often no step at all.
//
// THE INPUT QUEUE CAN BE REPLACED BY A FILE, once, behind `replay` in the open
// message: the presentation probe plays a committed recording rather than a
// hand, so that the reading it takes off a screen is taken over the same input
// every time. The driver is the block below `frame`, it is reachable from no
// page that did not say `?probe=present`, and `docs/presentation-probe.md` is
// what it is for.
//
// A classic worker rather than a module one, for the reason `task.worker.js` is:
// `importScripts` needs no MIME rules on somebody's static host, and the file it
// names sits beside this one because the site copies them all to the same
// directory. One spelling in this tree for "offload to a worker", not four.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It renders no sound and no picture: two consumers do
// that, out of the descriptions every step captures, each on a thread of its
// own and each down a `MessagePort` the page made and handed away - so the only
// thread between a step and a speaker, or a step and a pixel, is this one. And
// it holds no store: `localStorage` does not exist on this thread, so what it
// sends is the BLOB - `save` on the live state, once before frame 0 and then on
// every frame whose report carried `game_report_save` - and the page keeps the
// newest one and writes it. It writes no recording either, for the harder
// version of the same reason: a recording is wanted most by a page whose
// simulation has stopped answering, so what this sends is the entries its logs
// GREW BY, every frame, and the page composes the file out of a record it has
// been holding all along. Both are the same move - hold what a closing or a
// wedged page will need, so there is no round trip left to take.
//
// TWO CONSUMERS AGAIN, and they are fed on two different cadences. The speaker
// is handed the state of every STEP a tick ran, because a skipped 800 samples
// is a hole; the renderer is handed one description per TICK that drew, because
// a skipped picture is invisible. So a catch-up of eight steps is eight
// messages to the speaker, one to the renderer and one frame on the canvas.
// `madhousearcade`'s `docs/archived/threaded-host-plan.md` argued that
// asymmetry, and `player.js`'s `Consumer` reads both ends of it.

// `player.js` and nothing else, which is the whole of what this file is a shell
// over: `Session`, `Input`, `Clock`, `TaskRunner` and the arena are all that one
// file's, so this is a message protocol and no second host.

// space moves a resource when it compacts, and a resource held at the address
// it has left is a resource to hand over again.
//
// ONE MAP PER CONSUMER, and there are two: the speaker and the renderer hold
// separate copies of a resource at the same address in separate memories, and
// each is handed only the resources its own call may lock - the speaker the

//
// THE PAGE HOLDS THE RECORD, and that is not tidiness. Mark used to be a round

// A RECORDING PLAYED INSTEAD OF THE MOUSE, which is the presentation probe's
// half of this thread and is reachable from nowhere else.
//
// `docs/presentation-probe.md` is what it exists for. The question that probe
// asks - did a frame that was drawn reach the screen - is answered by comparing
// the instant the page committed a picture against what a screen capture
// decodes off the screen, and an answer is only worth having if the input was
// the same both times. A hand is not the same twice; a committed recording is.
// So the page fetches the file named by `?replay=<path>` behind
// `?probe=present`, hands its text over in `open`, and this plays it.
//
// WHAT THE FILE OVERRIDES. `seed`, `arg` and `save` are the run's header, so
// they outrank what the page composed out of its address bar and read out of
// its store - a recording carries what was DELIVERED rather than a reference to
// where it came from, which is what lets one play on any machine. The `input`,
// `tap` and `pointer` lines are change logs, and they drive `Input` at each
// frame exactly as `goldenhash.js`'s own frame reader does: the held set is the
// last `input` line at or before the frame, an edge is a button newly held or
// tapped, and the pointer is the last `pointer` line, `away` being absence and
// `nohover` a pointer that is there without hovering. A position is read by
// `coordinateOf`, frame pixels in decimal into 256ths, and one between two
// 256ths is the first refusal the file earns, refused before a byte of the run
// is built in the words `goldenhash.js` and `products/mark` refuse it in.
//
// IT IS THE RECORDER'S INVERSE, and that is a claim rather than a hope:
// `web_player_replays_a_recording_it_recorded` plays a committed recording
// through this driver under node and compares the `input`, `tap` and `pointer`
// entries the session writes back with the file's own lines. A driver that
// applied a press a frame late would be a probe measuring a run nobody
// recorded, and nothing about a picture on a screen would show it.
//
// THE PAGE'S HALTS ARE ANSWERED AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED, which is right for a
// probe and wrong for a player. A replayed run reads no queue, so the pointer
// leaving the canvas takes nothing from it and a `shed` steps nothing; and
// `idle` is masked out of the frame message above, because a page that stopped
// asking for frames would leave the capture reading a screen nothing draws to.
// That is why this exists behind `replay` alone and why `player.html` composes
// that field from the probe's own query and from nothing else.

//
// It is the probe's driver above with three differences, and each is the
// difference between a recording played to its end and one played up to a
// moment and then handed back.
//
// THE PREFIX IS STEPPED AS FAST AS THIS THREAD CAN, undrawn and unheard: no
// clock, no tick, no picture to the renderer, no sound to the worklet and no
// slot in the scrub ring - the first frame anything shows is the frame the
// recording ends on. The page's ticks are not answered while it runs, so the
// watchdog, which is armed by the first answer, is not yet watching: a `step`
// that never returns inside a prefix is outside it, as a `construct` that
// never returns is.
//
// EVERY ANSWER LANDS ON THE FRAME ITS `task` LINE NAMES. A body here finishes
// whenever its thread does, and an answer shown a frame early or late builds a
// different run and says nothing about it. So `Session.holdAnswer` takes each
// landing, the boundary of the frame a line names waits until every answer the
// line names has arrived and lands them there, with the line's own `taskfail`,
// and an answer no line names is held to the hand-over and landed then. A line
// naming an id this run has not spawned cannot be honoured at all, and is the
// divergence below.
//
// AND THE CONTROLS PASS TO THE HAND on the frame after the recording's `frame`:
// from there the queue the page has been filling all along drives the clock
// exactly as on any run. The recording's held buttons and its pointer are not
// carried over - a hand holds what a hand holds - so a resumed run's recording
// is the prefix, line for line, and then whatever the hand did.
//
// THE ARRIVAL IS CHECKED, NOT TRUSTED. A recording the page answered with
// carries the hash of the description its last frame captured, on the `#` line
// `snapshotText` in `player.js` writes, and a run arriving at another one - or
// one whose recording named a task it never spawned - says so in `resumed`.
// Nothing in this tree should ever trip it; it is what makes a hold that failed
// loud rather than a restore that drifted.
