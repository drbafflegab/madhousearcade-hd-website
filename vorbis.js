// and the golden's hasher - and the whole argument for this decoder is that
// every host computes the same samples. Two copies of the memory arithmetic
// below would be two chances to disagree about a module neither of them can
// see into, and `madhousearcade`'s `docs/decisions.md` at `3f4fdb8d` already
// records what a hand-mirrored layout costs when it drifts.
//
// It knows nothing about the console, exactly as `vorbis.h` does not: it
// reports what the stream held and refuses nothing on grounds of rate or
// layout. A caller with a narrower requirement than the decoder's supported set
// checks `info` and says so itself.
//
// Loaded the way `player.js` is - a classic script in a browser, a CommonJS
// module under node - so the site needs no module MIME rules and node needs no
// package.json in the deployable.

// `Vorbis_Info` is three 32-bit fields, hand-mirrored here. The header pins its
// size with a `static_assert`, which guards C and says nothing about this file;
// what guards this one is that a wrong offset yields a rate or a channel count
// no caller accepts, and every caller checks both.
