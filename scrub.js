// The scrub bar: the track a paused page floats over the bottom of the console
// under `?scrub=on`, and the label that names a new tempo for a moment.
//
// `player.html` owns everything about it that is a decision - the keys, the
// pacing, when the bar opens and shuts and what the simulation is asked - and
// `sim.worker.js` owns the ring and the cursor. What is left here is the
// picture of where the cursor stands and the hand on it: one track, filled from
// the oldest frame the ring still holds up to the cursor, with the cursor drawn
// across it, and a pointer that sets the cursor where it presses and drags it
// from there.
//
// NOTHING ELSE ON IT, which is the owner's reading of the first version: the
// floor, the head and the frame number were text nobody needed while looking,
// and a tick per recorded input was a mark nobody could read. What that gives
// up is the frame number as a bridge to `inspector dump --frame`, which the
// bar no longer prints; the simulation still answers every move with it.
//
// OVER THE CONSOLE, AND ONLY HERE. The page keeps its chrome off the picture
// for the ordinary player, and under `?scrub=on` the owner decided on
// 2026-10-05 that the bar and the tempo label go over it - the bar 12 px in
// from the sides and the bottom of the canvas's box, the label in the middle -
// so this is a decision for this mode and not an oversight. Neither takes room
// in the flow, so neither is in `available` and neither refits the canvas;
// both read the canvas's box when they are placed, and the bar is placed again
// whenever that box can have moved: a refit, a resize, fullscreen.
//
// A CLASSIC SCRIPT AND A CONTINUATION OF THE PAGE'S OWN, as `probe.js` is: the
// page appends it after its own script has run, two classic scripts share one
// global lexical environment, and the three functions the page's hooks call
// are declared here - `scrubShown` with each answer the simulation gives,
// `scrubHide` when the pause ends, and `scrubTempoShown` when `S` changes the
// speed. The page asks whether they exist before calling them, because this
// file is fetched and an answer can beat it.

// The bar and its track, built once on first use and kept for the life of the
// page: a reset is a new ring under the same bar.
