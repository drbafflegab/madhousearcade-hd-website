// The player's browser-free half: everything between a module's bytes and the
// pixels a host hands to a screen.
//
// `player.html` is the other half, and the line between them is exactly the
// browser. Anything that touches `document`, a canvas, an `AudioContext` or
// `requestAnimationFrame` is in the page; nothing else is. What is left here is
// the whole of what a host has to get right about a game - the struct offsets,
// the three records it hands a game and the trampoline that makes them callable,
// the answer protocol, the input queue, the clock that decides how many steps
// an interval owes and the background - and it lives in a file of its own so that
// it can be run without a browser at all.
// `cmake/WebPlayerPlays.cmake` is what runs it that way, over the assembled
// site, and its header says which of the page's claims survive the move and
// which went with the browser.
//
// THERE ARE TWO SIDES OF THE GAME IN HERE NOW, and the line between them is a
// thread rather than a browser. `Session` is the SIMULATION - it constructs,
// steps, runs the tasks and records - and `Consumer` is what renders somewhere
// else: a second instance of the same module, handed a description and the
// resources its scope names at their own addresses, on which the game's own
// `render_video` and `render_audio` are called and `construct` and `step` never
// are.
// `sim.worker.js` holds the first and the page holds the second, and both are
// this file's because a consumer needs no browser either.
//
// Loaded three ways, and it has to stay loadable all three:
//
// - As a classic `<script src="player.js">` ahead of the page's own inline
//   script, where every declaration below lands in the global lexical scope the
//   inline script then reads. Not a module script: that is a second set of MIME
//   rules to satisfy on somebody's static host, for nothing the page needs.
// - Through `importScripts` in `task.worker.js` and `sim.worker.js`, which is
//   the same classic-script rule one realm over.
// - As CommonJS under node, through the four lines at the foot of this file.
//   `module` is undefined in a browser, so the page never runs them.

// Mirrors interface/game.h for wasm32, where pointers are 4 bytes. THIS MUST BE
// KEPT IN STEP WITH THE HEADER BY HAND: nothing here reads DWARF, so a field
// added to Game or Channel shifts these offsets silently. The eventual fix is
// to generate this block from the module's own debug info, which the CLI will
// be able to do once it parses DWARF.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

const LAYOUT = {
    // `maxTaskCount` is the newest member and `bytes` moved 52 to 56 with it, which
    // is the whole toll a tail addition charges this mirror: no offset above it
    // moved, on either target. Verified against the built modules rather than
    // read off the header - `factory` writes 2 at offset 52 of
    // `games/example/artifacts/example.wasm` and nothing at 56, and a module
    // declaring none leaves the word the host zero filled.
    //
    // A mirror that FORGOT this member reads 0, and 0 is the legal declaration
    // meaning *this game spawns nothing* - so the page would refuse every spawn
    // a working game makes. That is why `web_player_plays`'s identity check has
    // `max_task_count` as its sixth field and why `games/example` declares a
    // non-zero one.
    //
    // ARGUMENTS MOVED NOTHING HERE, and that is the thing to know about them at
    // this offset table. A game declares nothing about them - a run passes
    // pairs through and a game reads the ones it recognises by name - so no
    // member went in, `bytes` is what it was before a run could be told
    // anything at all, and the identity check `web_player_plays` runs is six
    // fields rather than seven. What arguments DID move is `construct`'s
    // ARITY, which no offset in this block can see and which the arity check
    // further down is the whole reader of.
    // SAVE STATE moved two members in, at the tail again, and `bytes` went 56
    // to 64. `saveSize` is read for the same reason `maxTaskCount` is - a mirror one
    // field short reads 0, which is the legal declaration meaning *this game
    // persists nothing*, so a saving game would be constructed from null with
    // every other check green.
    // THE CAPTURES moved four more in, at the tail again, and `bytes` went 64
    // to 80. The two sizes fail exactly as `saveSize` does - a mirror one field
    // short reads 0, which is the legal declaration meaning *the state block IS
    // the description* - so a game that captures would be handed its own block
    // and drawn from the wrong bytes. Every game in this tree declares 0 today
    // and this page refuses anything else by name, which is what stops the two
    // paths coexisting before there is a second one to coexist with.
    //
    // A BLEND SAT BETWEEN THE SAVE PAIR AND THE CAPTURES, at 64, and every
    // offset behind it was four bytes further out while it did. It is gone, and
    // the four that follow moved down with it - which is the one edit a tail
    // rule cannot spare a hand-written mirror, and the reason every figure here
    // was taken from the header's own assert rather than counted.
    //
    // `maxResourceCount` is the tail again, and `bytes` went 80 to 84 with it. A
    // mirror one field short reads 0, which is the legal declaration of no
    // resources at all, so every loading task would fail at its commit with
    // every other check green.
    //
    // `maxScratchBytes` is the tail once more, and `bytes` went 84 to 88. A
    // mirror one field short reads 0, the legal declaration that no body of
    // this game asks for scratch, so every spawn of a body that does would end
    // the run instead of running. The NATIVE `sizeof` did not move for it - the
    // member landed in tail padding the pointers were already paying for -
    // which is why the figures here are the header's wasm32 half rather than a
    // reading of either build.
    //
    // THE THREE RESOURCE BYTE FIGURES are the tail after that, and `bytes` went
    // 88 to 100. A mirror short of them reads 0 for each, the legal declaration
    // that this game holds no bytes in that scope, so every loading task would
    // fail at its commit - by the byte rule rather than by the count, which is
    // the same silence in a different sentence.
    //
    // THE FRAME'S PAIR is the tail after those, and `bytes` went 100 to 108. A
    // mirror short of both reads 0 for each, which this page refuses at load.
    //
    // THE PICTURE'S CHANGE moved every member after `version`: the palette's
    // pointer left, four bytes here, and `background` became a three byte
    // `Game_Color` that the alignment of `maxTaskCount` absorbs. Then
    // `maxSpriteCount` and `maxTextureResourceBytes` went in at the tail and
    // `bytes` went 104 to 112. A mirror short of `maxSpriteCount` reads a list
    // with no room, so the first sprite a working game lists ends its run.

// implementation rather than three. `docs/host-core-rules.md` is the
// measurement that says which sentences those are and where each one used to
// live; `madhousearcade`'s `docs/archived/host-core-plan.md` is why they moved.

// input log identical. No golden can see that - a run that will not start
// records nothing to compare against the run that did. Two mirrors of one
// number are now one number.

// The CHARSETS went with them. An argument's name is `[a-z0-9_]+` and a value
// is printable ASCII with no outer space, and both are settled in
// `products/host-core` against the same list every host settles.

// The one predicate about a value this file kept, and it DECIDES NOTHING.
// `host_core_settle_arguments` answers a bad value with one verdict where this
// page has two sentences for it - a byte outside printable ASCII, and an outer
// space - so this chooses which of the two to say about a value the rulebook
// has already refused. `docs/host-core-rules.md` measures that the three hosts

// that shows the last thirty seconds again, which says how the page looks and
// nothing about the run - so a recording made under it has no business
// carrying it as a pair, and none does. `resume` is the fourth and says where
// the run comes FROM: `resume=message` opens nothing until a page of this site

// that was running it, which is the same exit a refusal at load takes.
//
// `console_fault` is the native half and does not stop the run - it keeps the

// to hand one to, so it stops where the console records, and the WHEN is what
// the two hosts have to agree about rather than the what-next.
//
// Where the reason is SHOWN is the one part of this a browser owns, so it is
// the one part that is injected: the page hangs its HUD banner here, and a host

// pointer is an index into the module's own `__indirect_function_table`. So
// this host has a problem the native one does not: `console.c` writes the
// addresses of its `static` functions into its records and is done, and a
// JavaScript closure is not a wasm function and a funcref table will not hold
// one.
//
// `products/trampoline` is the answer, and it is one small wasm module: seven
// functions with exactly the signatures the record members declare, each
// forwarding to a closure it was instantiated with. This host instantiates it
// once per instance it has to reach into - the game's, each renderer's, and a
// fresh one per task body - grows that instance's table by seven and writes the
// wrappers in, then puts the indices they landed at into the records it
// composes.
//
// `madhousearcade`'s `docs/archived/capability-records-plan.md` calls this out
// as what the design accepts, and it is the whole of the cost: one mechanism,
// built once, tested like anything else. Every rule about a spawn, a status, a

// Tasks: the body, run in a second instance of the same module.
//
// `Game_Task.body` is a function pointer, and on wasm32 a function pointer is
// an INDEX into the module's indirect function table. The element segment that
// fills that table is part of the module, so a fresh instance of the same bytes
// puts the same function at the same index - which is the whole mechanism here:
// the host instantiates the module again and calls `table.get(index)` against
// THAT instance's linear memory.
//
// What it buys is the isolation `interface/game.h` states rather than merely
// promises. The game's instance and the task's share nothing at all: not the
// state block, not the globals, not the arena. `console.c` reaches the same
// isolation by forking, which is the same sentence spelled for a target that
// has processes, and `goldenhash.js` reaches it exactly as this does.
//
// This function is the whole of what crosses the thread boundary, and it is a
// free function rather than a method for that reason: `task.worker.js` reaches
// it through `importScripts` and calls it with a module that arrived over
// `postMessage`, while a host with no `Worker` calls it on its own thread. One
// writer, two callers, and nothing about the answer differs between them.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// One body, to completion, in an instance of its own.
//
// A FRESH instance per body, for the reason the console forks per spawn rather
// than once: scratch and output are zero because linear memory begins zero, and
// a body that wrote to a global cannot reach the next one. Measured under node
// against `borrower.wasm`: 0.13 ms to compile the module and 0.034 ms an
// instantiate, so a spawn costs the second of those and the module is compiled
// once, wherever it is compiled.
//
// The answer is `{ output, note, reads }`, and a null `output` becomes a
// failure the runner's `status` answers, which means one thing only: the host
// could not run it, the host abandoned it, or the body did not finish. `note`
// is what `Console_Task.diagnostic` is natively - what the run has to say about
// the failure - and there is far less of it for a trap here, because a wasm
// trap carries no file and no line where a native sanitizer prints both.
// `reads` is every resource the body asked for and what became of it, which is
// this host's half of `inspector dump --resources` and reaches no game.
//
// ABANDONMENT IS A THROW, and it is the whole of how this target keeps the
// header's hardest sentence: a loader's `load` does not return to its caller
// when the host cannot answer. There is no process to end here as there is
// natively - `madhousearcade`'s `docs/archived/unified-tasks-phase0/probes.md`
// at `3f4fdb8d`, section 6, measured that half - so the closure throws, the
// throw crosses the trampoline, and it unwinds the wasm frames into the catch
// below. Section 6's web half measured all of it: the throw arrives as an
// ordinary `Error` rather than a `WebAssembly.RuntimeError`, so a host
// inability and a trapping body stay distinguishable; a fresh instance
// afterwards answers normally; and a `worker_threads` thread running the
// shipped protocol survives one and runs the next body.
//
// **A partially written output is still in the instance when the throw lands**,
// which is the same finding the native probe made about its `MAP_SHARED`
// mapping and matters for the same reason: abandoning a body is not on its own
// enough to keep half an answer from escaping. What keeps it in is the `return`
// below - a null `output`, computed nowhere - rather than anything about the
// instance, and a host that reached for the output region in the catch would
// hand a game a structurally valid answer over a buffer nothing filled.
//
// Everything a body can throw is caught here and nowhere else, because only
// here is a throw a failed TASK rather than a failed run: a trap arrives as
// `WebAssembly.RuntimeError`, and a `body` index past the table's bound arrives
// from `get` as a `RangeError`, which is the same answer the native host gives
// a function pointer that is not one - a child that died.
//
// Nothing bounds how long a body runs, exactly as nothing bounds it natively.
// A body that never returns is a worker that never answers, and the game waits
// for an answer that never comes - which is what it does for a task the host is
// still running, and a game can tell the two apart by nothing at all.
//
// `read` is the host's reader, or null for a host that has no bytes to offer.
// `trampoline` is `products/trampoline`'s compiled module, which is how the
// loader record this body is handed gets a `load` it can call at all.
//
// `core` is a `HostCore`, and it is here rather than in the session because
// this is where the descriptor grammar is spent: a body's read is answered in
// the body's own instance, on the thread the body runs on, so the six rules a
// `Game_Resource` is held to have to be reachable from there. It is the ONE
// thing about a task the rulebook is needed for on this side of the message -
// a body's own `spawn`, `status` and `finalize` are inert wrappers, because
// `interface/game.h` says a body loads files and cannot spawn - so what a

// `VorbisDecoder` is the shape this follows, deliberately and line for line:
// one thing in this tree already offloads work to a worker and falls back
// inline, and a second spelling of it would be a second thing to get wrong. The
// promise is the same promise either way, so nothing above here has two paths.
//
// ONE WORKER PER LIVE TASK, created at the spawn, ended at the answer, and
// ended at a `finalize` that beats the answer. What it replaced is a single
// resident worker every body queued behind, and the reversal buys two things
// that one could not offer.
//
// A pending `finalize` becomes a REAL CANCEL. It promises the game that the id
// it took is never answered, and a worker of its own can be terminated where it
// stands, because nothing else is behind it, so the promise is kept by stopping
// the work rather than by discarding it.
//
// And the two hosts stop being asymmetric about who runs a body. `console.c`
// forks a process at the spawn; this starts a thread at the spawn. One body,
// one execution context, one target's spelling of the other's sentence - where
// before, one host had a context per body and the other had one for all of
// them.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, measured rather than argued, because accepting a hit is worth
// nothing without the number beside it. In Chrome 151 a `new Worker (url)` over
// `task.worker.js`, primed with the compiled module and handed one body,
// answers in a median 4.6 to 4.9 ms, against 37 to 43 us for a round trip to a
// worker that is already warm. The page's OWN thread pays neither: the
// constructor and the priming post together are 22 to 23 us on the frame that
// spawned - 0.13% of one at 60 Hz - and every other part of that 5 ms happens
// off the frame. Under node's `worker_threads` the same reading is a median
// 16.4 to 17.4 ms, because a node thread is a fresh V8 isolate where a
// browser's worker is not, and nothing in this tree ships to node.
//
// So a light task's answer arrives about 5 ms later than it did and the frame
// that asked for it costs the same. That is the trade, and it is taken because
// this is not a real-time job system: `interface/game.h` prices a body in
// seconds - an opponent's search, a solver, a level's worth of decoded bytes -
// and a game that wanted an answer inside the frame would compute it in `step`.
//
// The module goes across COMPILED rather than as bytes, with the one task the
// worker exists for - `WebAssembly.Module` is cloneable to a dedicated worker,
// which shares this agent cluster - so a worker never recompiles what this
// thread has already compiled. Cloning it per worker rather than once is what
// `madhousearcade`'s `docs/archived/unified-tasks-phase0/probes.md` at
// `3f4fdb8d`, section 1, measured as free: the clone surcharge is 0.0012 to
// 0.0019 ms and INDEPENDENT of module size, which is what a clone by reference
// looks like and what a serialise-and-recompile would not.
//
// It also carries WHERE the bytes are, and that is the whole of what a worker is
// told about resources: a directory, posted with the module, out of which it
// builds `resourceReader` for itself. Nothing crosses this boundary per read - a
// body's read is a synchronous XHR on its own worker's thread, which is why this
// thread never hears about one until the answer comes back.

// `localStorage`, under `arcade:save:<name>` with the module's own declared name,
// and the value is the blob in the one spelling a blob has anywhere it leaves a
// host's memory - lowercase hex, two characters a byte. It is the same text a
// recording's `save` line carries and the same text `inspector save` writes, so
// every round trip between the three is string equality: a store value pasted
// into a replay replays, and a replay's line diffed against a store reads.
//
// EVERY DEFECT IS DISCARDED TO ZEROS, SILENTLY, and that is the whole ladder -
// an absent key, an odd number of digits, a stray character and a byte count
// that is not this module's `save_size` each deliver `save_size` zeros and start
// the run. It is the opposite of what `inspector --save` does with a file it
// was handed, and deliberately so: a path a person typed and got wrong is a
// mistake they can fix, where a store defect is a byte a browser lost with
// nobody to tell. A page a corrupt byte can wedge is worse than a lost score.
//
// A blob is never refused for its CONTENT either, on any path. The host keeps
// the bytes and interprets none of them, so a blob of the right length that
// says nothing this game understands is the game's to discard - which is what
// `games/example`'s version word is for.
//
// `save` is deliberately not a third key this page keeps. Reserving it would
// say the address bar can address the store, and the debate settled that it
// must not: saves are not link-composable, so a pair named `save` is an
// ordinary argument like any other and reaches the game.
//
// WHAT NOTHING HERE PRETENDS. The store is the player's to read and to edit,
// origin `null` is shared on `file://` so any local page can reach the key, and
// a single-player score on the machine that set it is not a threat model.

// into `localStorage` from each handler and a second launch on the same profile
// that read the marks back:
//
// - Navigating away runs `visibilitychange`, then `pagehide`, then `unload`,
//   and every one of their writes survives. So does quitting the browser.
// - Closing the TAB runs `visibilitychange` and `beforeunload` and their writes
//   survive - and `pagehide` and `unload` never run at all. Three repeats, both
//   modes. That is the one moment `pagehide` alone would have missed, and it is
//   the commonest way a game is left.
// - Killing the process runs nothing, which is what the interval below is for
//   and the only reason it is not decoration.

// `pagehide` catches the back/forward cache, which a visibility change alone
// does not describe - and neither is trusted to be the last word.

// ResourceSpace: the region ONE INSTANCE holds ONE SCOPE's resources in, as two
// halves it moves between.
//
// A region of an instance's memory rather than a memory of its own: an instance
// reserves twice its declared figure once, when the run opens, and never grows
// for a resource again. That reservation is the whole reason this class exists
// - a `memory.grow` detaches every view in the instance, and a grow taken on a
// thread with a deadline is a copy nothing can budget.
//
// TWO HALVES, ONE ACTIVE, and a bump pointer in it. A freed resource leaves a
// hole that nothing reuses until the next compaction, and a compaction runs
// only when a placement needs one: the load fits by sum but not in what is left
// of the active half. Every copy then lands in FREE space in the other half, so
// no move can overwrite bytes a call is still reading and a compaction always
// completes - which is what the alternatives could not promise, and
// `madhousearcade`'s `docs/resource-space-plan.md` at `3f4fdb8d`, §10, is where
// the two that wedge are written down.
//
// PLACEMENT IS CHUNKED, through two primitives and no more: `pending` asks
// whether there is work and `copy` does at most so many bytes of it. What
// spends them is the caller's business - this file drives them to completion
// where the bytes arrive, which is where the copy happened before this class
// existed, and the loop that spends them against a deadline is the plan's phase
// 7. So an answer's frame is exactly what it was.
//
// A SWITCH INSIDE A CALL IS REFUSED rather than deferred. A block's entry moves
// to its new address in the gap AFTER its last chunk lands, so a call between
// chunks locks the old address, which is complete and correct because a
// resource is never written. A switch under a call that is already open would
// give one lock two addresses, and there is no answer to that but to stop.
//
// A SPACE OVER NO MEMORY HOLDS ADDRESSES ONLY. It is the same arithmetic - the
// two halves, the bump pointer, the compaction a load that fits by sum earns,
// the chunks - with every byte copy left out, and it is what the simulation
// keeps for a resource only `render_audio` locks: the speaker puts the bytes at
// the address in a memory of its own, and this instance must neither read them
// nor hold a copy of them. A move then changes an ADDRESS and copies nothing,
// and whoever holds the bytes is handed them again at the new one -
// `publishResources` says how.

    // can call through and there is no session to build. It sits beside the
    // game's bytes for that reason - the two halves the plug-in ABI now has,
    // in the order they matter.
    //
    // `workerUrl` is where `task.worker.js` sits, and a host that leaves it out
    // gets a session that runs task bodies on its own thread. That degrades
    // gracefully and is exactly what a browser must not do - a body is seconds
    // of work by design, and on this thread those are seconds the page is
    // frozen - so the page passes it and this comment is the whole of the
    // reason it must. `plays.js` leaves it out on purpose, because node has no
    // `Worker` to offload to anyway.
    //
    // `seed` is the number this run reproduces from, and it is a parameter of
    // its own rather than one of the pairs below for the reason
    // `interface/game.h` gives: it is the one thing every host composes for
    // itself and the one thing no game has to ask for. A run SPELLS it as a
    // pair and `queryArguments` hands back what `host_core_extract_seed` took
    // out, so what arrives here is a number whatever the address said - and a
    // caller composing a list by hand is a caller that already decided, exactly
    // as `console_start` is handed one.
    //
    // `args` is the rest of what the run was told, as `[{ name, value }]` with
    // both members strings, and it is a pass-through: nothing on the module
    // says a word about it in advance, so there is nothing here to match it
    // against. What this constructor owes it is FORMAT and never meaning -
    // `argumentList` below is the whole of that - and then one flat run of
    // `Game_Pair` in linear memory for `construct` to read.
    //
    // `store` is where this host keeps what a game rendered through `save`, and
    // it is LAST because it is the one parameter a session can do without: a
    // caller that leaves it out constructs from zeros, which is what a host
    // holding nothing hands over anyway, and writes nothing back. Every harness
    // in `ctest` but this file's own store cases leaves it out, and so does

    //   output into the game's own bytes once. The slot and the block go at
    //   the next boundary, so a game at its limit that finalizes and spawns in
    //   its place inside one `step` is answered 0 and spawns next frame.

    //   so does which resources the store holds: a task's loads and unloads
    //   settle at the boundary that shows its answer, in task id order.
    // - **A spawn with no slot answers 0**, mints nothing and touches nothing,
    //   which is a condition a game acts on. A MALFORMED spawn, an INVALID id
    //   and a lock the store refuses end the run instead, and each of those
    //   sentences is byte for byte the console's and the golden's:

// was given plus whatever the module's own data segments put there, and what it
// runs on them is the game's own `render_video`, `render_audio` and `save` -
// so a game cannot tell that a renderer ran here rather than in the instance
// that stepped, and could only tell by reading a mutable byte outside the state
// block, which `cmake/CheckStatics.cmake` already refuses.
//
// IT TAKES NO IMPORTS AND HOLDS NO SESSION, and it installs a trampoline and a
// rulebook of its own so that a description can name a resource. A renderer
// calls no host function but `lock` and `unlock`, and those are answered out of
// a store this instance keeps as a MIRROR of the session's - filled from the
// rows a session publishes, through `host_core_mirror_entry`, so a lock here
// is refused by the same entry point and in the same sentence as a lock in the
// simulation. A `Consumer` built without either still renders, and hands its
// renderers the null store, which a game that names no resource never notices.
//
// IT LAYS NO ARENA DOWN. Every address it uses arrives in the `layout` its
// session published, so there is no second copy of the prologue here that could
// drift from the one in `Session` above. What it does for itself is grow its
// memory to cover an address it is handed, which is the one thing a bump

// Where a resource directory is: the one question about resources this half of
// the player still answers.
//
// `<name>.<format>` in ONE directory, read by a task body when it wants the
// bytes. The same file `inspector` reads, byte for byte, rather than a twin of
// it in some encoding the page understands and the CLI does not - so both hosts
// read one layout and one file, and a sprite edited on disk is a sprite both
// have read.
//
// WHICH directory is decided once, here, and the answer is handed to the
// session, which posts it to the worker a body runs in. By default it is
// `resources/` beside the MODULE and not beside the page: there is one page and
// many games, so resolved against the page every read of every game would look
// in the player's own directory, find nothing, and fail the task - a game
// drawing its fallback for ever with nothing on screen to say why. That failure
// is silent by construction, which is why `web_player_plays_example` exists.
//
// The directory is passed in rather than read from the page, because this is
// the seam that check exists to hold: the page resolves its query string
// against itself and hands the result over, and a host with no page at all
// composes the same directory the same way.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Which directory a game's resources are in, resolved once so that a value this
// page cannot make sense of is a refusal naming it rather than a 404 per load.
//
// `player.html?module=<url>&resources=<directory>`. Absent - which is every URL
// the menu writes, and the whole of what this page did before - the answer is
// `resources/` beside the module, and nothing else here runs. Present, it is
// the directory named, and one module then plays against content that was never
// built beside it: many sets of bytes, no rebuild, and no directory per variant
// holding its own copy of the module.
//
// A DIRECTORY rather than a template or a base with a hole in it, and the same
// directory `inspector --resources D` names - the one holding
// `<name>.<format>`, not a parent with a `resources/` inside it. That is what
// lets one string move between the two hosts, so a run recorded here is
// reproducible there; the CLI has had the flag since before this page did, so
// the parity cost nothing.
//
// Resolved against the PAGE and not against the module, which is the one
// decision here that could have gone the other way. Against the module it would
// share a base with the default, and the literal `resources` would spell that
// default exactly - but `?module=games/pong/pong.wasm&resources=boards/set07`
// would then mean `games/pong/boards/set07`, so two parameters written side by
// side in one query string would resolve against two different bases. Against
// the page they resolve against the one URL they are a query of. It is also
// what keeps the deployable portable: `location.href` already carries whatever
// prefix a host mounted the site at, so a relative value works from a root and
// from a subdirectory of one, exactly as every other URL in the site does.
//
// Five refusals, and the last four are each a URL this page would otherwise
// fetch:
//
// - The parameter written with nothing after it. Naming no directory is not
//   the same as leaving the parameter off, so it is not answered as though it
//   were: the caller meant to say something and said nothing.
// - Another origin. A cross-origin resource directory is a different feature -
//   it has a CORS story and a trust story - and this is not it.
// - A path separator that arrived percent-encoded. See below; without it the
//   next rule is decorative.
// - Above the site. `player.html` sits at the root of the deployable, so the
//   directory the page is in IS the site, and a value climbing out of it is
//   refused by name rather than fetched from somewhere else on the host.
// - A query or a fragment. A filename is composed onto this directory, which
//   drops both silently, so a caller who wrote one would be served out of a
//   directory they did not name.
//
// What is NOT refused is a directory inside the site holding nothing. That is a
// 404 per load, `failed` to the game, and the fallback it already draws - and
// no host can tell it apart from a set of bytes nobody has built yet.

// `moduleUrl` rather than `module`, which is the one name in this file that
// cannot be reused: the node door at the foot of it reads a CommonJS `module`
// out of the enclosing scope, and a parameter wearing that name would shadow it
// for anything written here later.
//
// Both bases are whatever `new URL` takes for one - the page hands over its own
// `location.href` as the string it is, and a host without a page hands over the
// URL object it already built. `named` is the query parameter exactly as it was
// read: null when it is absent, a string when it is there, and the empty string
// when it was written with nothing after it, which is the one of the three that
// is refused.
//

// stops being bare - what a reader copies out of the address bar is the run
// they were looking at rather than an instruction to roll another one.
//
// ABSENCE IS THE SPELLING FOR A FRESH SEED, and it replaced a sentinel.
// `random` was one value of this key that was not a number, so it was the one
// thing a run could say that no other grammar would carry - legal here and
// refused under `inspector`, with nothing able to compare the two runs because
// a run that will not start records nothing. Absence says the same thing for no
// rule at all, and it is what a menu card can be written as: a card that named
// a seed would hand every reader one constant run for ever.
//
// MERGED RATHER THAN REPLACED, which is measured rather than reasoned. The
// probe behind `replaceState` - Chrome 152, over `http` from a subdirectory,
// path preserved, no reload and no history entry - also measured a whole-query
// replacement DROPPING the keys already there. What goes back is the segments
// this page was handed, in the order it was handed them, with the composed ones
// appended.
//
// Spliced out of the raw segments rather than composed through a
// `URLSearchParams`, whose serializer re-encodes what it never had to:
// `module=games/pong/pong.wasm` comes back as
// `module=games%2Fpong%2Fpong.wasm`, and a link that changed shape while the
// reader was looking at it is not one they recognise as the one they opened.
//
// EVERYTHING NONDETERMINISTIC IS A PARAMETER - the roll, the clock, and the
// browser's own `History` - so this file still reaches for no global at all and
// a caller that hands over none composes nothing and publishes nothing. A page
// hands over all three; a harness hands over stubs and can count the calls.
//
// It runs FIRST, before a byte of the module is fetched, because it is the only
// reader that can change the address. `queryArguments` below then reads the run

// another, and a recording written later carries what was rolled by
// construction rather than by a rule somebody has to remember.

// heard of is a key for a harness, for a menu or for the next version of it,
// and the run starts regardless. What is left to check is FORMAT, which
// `argumentList` below owns and this function ends by spending.
//
// Split by hand rather than through `URLSearchParams`, for the reason
// `composeRun` splits by hand: that class is a serializer as well as a parser
// and re-encodes what it never had to, and here it is worse than cosmetic - it
// hands out a MULTIMAP with `get` answering the first of two, which is exactly
// the silent preference between two things a reader wrote that this refuses.
// Its DECODING is what a browser does and is reproduced: `+` is a space and
// `%NN` is a byte, both applied to the key and to the value.
//
// The four keys this page keeps are dropped here and never reach a game:
// `module` says which game this is, `resources` says which bytes it plays
// against, `scrub` says how the page shows a pause and `resume` says where the
// run starts from, and none of them is an argument any more than a filename
// typed at a shell is. FOUR and not five: a
// pair named `save` is passed through like any other, because reserving it
// would say the address bar can address the store and saves are deliberately
// not link-composable.

// `seed` GOES IN WITH THE PAIRS AND COMES BACK OUT THROUGH THE RULEBOOK, which
// is what this function gained when the key stopped being held back here.

// walks cannot carry it whatever the query said. Absence is REPORTED rather

// Input, queued rather than applied where it arrives, because the page's loop
// can run several steps in one animation frame. Folding a key straight into
// `buttons` gives every one of those steps the same final state: a press late
// in the window is back-dated onto steps that simulate time before it happened,
// and a tap that began and ended inside the window cancels itself out and is
// never seen at all.
//
// So each event carries the instant it arrived, and a step consumes only those
// at or before the instant it is drained to. `event.timeStamp` shares a clock
// with the timestamp `requestAnimationFrame` is passed - measured - but that
// timestamp is the frame's nominal start and can predate an event already in
// hand, which is why the caller advances a clock of its own in fixed steps
// instead of taking the animation frame's timestamp as every step's boundary:
// the steps of a catch-up burst simulate earlier time and have to drain to
// earlier instants, or a press lands on a step that ran before it.
//
// What a callback's timestamp predating an event does NOT do is lose the event.
// A drain reaching an instant an event is past leaves it queued for the next
// step, exactly as a boundary standing further behind does - so a drain that
// only ever reaches FORWARD costs nothing, and `Clock.advance` does reach
// forward, to the callback's own instant, for the LAST step of a burst and no
// other. That step is the one whose state the page is about to show.
//
// Input is still sampled once per step, but a press that arrives and departs
// between two boundaries is no longer lost: draining records it in `edges`,
// which the step reports as `Game_Button_State.edge` with `held` clear.
//
// The pointer goes through the same queue, and has to: a move is as much an
// instant as a press, and a position folded straight in would be back-dated
// onto every step in the window exactly as a key would. What it does not have
// is an edge, because a position is where something is rather than something
// that happened - what it borrows instead is the latch, for the reason

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why the loop is not stepping, which is three independent things.
//
// `paused` is the PLAYER's. `Enter` sets it, it is sticky, and nothing but
// `Enter` clears it: a run that unpaused itself because a tab came back would
// be overturning a decision the player had already made. It was Escape until
// the page grew a fullscreen mode, which the browser also spends Escape on and
// does not let the page keep.
//
// `hidden` is the HOST's. It follows page visibility in both directions and the
// player never sees it happen, because by definition they were not looking. A
// game left running and audible behind the menu it was navigated away from was
// the reported bug; a game that then demanded a keypress before playing again
// was the same bug pointing the other way, and conflating the two is what made
// the second the only available fix for the first.
//
// `idle` is the GAME's, and it is the third reason the pair above was written
// to expect: "any host that grows one gets a flag rather than a rewrite" is
// that sentence, spent. `game_report_idle` says no further state change is
// coming until input arrives or a task result does, and `step` is a pure
// function of state, input and results - so the claim propagates itself for as
// long as both hold still, and a host may simply stop calling it. The wake list
// SHRANK with the events array: a status now changes only by an answer or by
// the game's own finalize, and a finalize is something a `step` did.
//
// It differs from the other two in the direction that matters, and the
// difference is who is expected to notice. `paused` is undone by the player and
// `hidden` by the page; `idle` has to undo ITSELF, because from the player's
// side nothing ever happened - the game did not stop, it ran out of things to
// do, and pressing a key is the whole of getting it back. So everything that
// can move a game clears this flag: every event the input queue accepts, every
// task result that lands, and every move of the two flags above. The loop sets it
// again one step later if the game says so again, and one step of a game that
// was about to be stepped anyway is the whole price of being wrong in that
// direction. Being wrong in the other direction is a game that never comes
// back, which is why nothing here waits to be sure.
//
// The truth table is three booleans now rather than two, and it is still here
// rather than in the page for the reason it always was: this half of the player
// runs under node, and a state machine spelled in event handlers is one no
// check without a browser could ever read.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Whether the loop should be stepping at all.
function halted (halt) { return halt.paused || halt.hidden || halt.idle; }

// And whether anybody has stopped LISTENING, which is the player's flag and the
// host's but never the game's: both of these mean somebody stopped listening
// this instant, where a game with nothing to do is still being watched. It is
// the whole of what puts the sound away AT ONCE - a game at rest is put away
// on a timer instead, which is the page's - so it is a function rather than an
// OR written twice: `haltChange` answers `stop` on it, and the page re-reads it
// on the frame a pause is waiting for, where reading the wider one would put
// away a game that had merely rested inside a round trip.
function silenced (halt) { return halt.paused || halt.hidden; }

// What a change to those three flags asks of the page.
//
// `shed` is what the page throws away, in the three spellings it has, and they
// are the whole reason this is a function rather than a pile of conditions at
// the call site. `stepped` is the pointer leaving as one real frame, because a
// paused game goes on drawing the crosshair its own state holds and the player
// is looking straight at it. `quiet` is the same departure with no frame spent
// on it, because there is nothing on screen to look at: the first step after
// the page comes back reports whatever is true then. `backlog` is the other
// direction - everything queued while the player was not playing belongs to no
// frame, because no frame ran, so it is applied and its edges dropped before
// the loop starts again. A game resting is not one of the three: nothing was
// taken from the player, so nothing is owed back.
//
// `run` is the loop alone. It used to be the sound as well, and that is exactly
// what the third flag parts: the loop stops the instant a game rests, and the
// sound does not.
//
// `sound` is why. `stop` is the sound ending now, because the player paused or
// looked away and under the worklet's model emitting nothing means SUSTAIN, so
// a game stopped mid-note would drone on. `rest` is a game that has merely gone
// quiet by itself, where putting the sound away on the instant would build an
// audio context once per move for the whole of a game that thinks between
// moves - so the page waits it out, and how long is the page's business rather
// than this function's. `start` is either of those undone.
//
// The third answer was taken out for a day and is back. What it was blamed for
// - a move after a long rest reaching the screen hundreds of milliseconds late
// - outlived its removal and belonged to the canvas layer's commit path, which
// `render.worker.js` now keeps awake by writing on every display frame;
// `madhousearcade`'s `docs/runs/scan-out-run.md` holds both readings.
function haltChange (before, after) {

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What a wall clock instant owes a game: how many steps a callback is worth,
// the boundary the input queue is drained to, the cap on a catch-up and the
// decision that a run may stop.
//
// All of it used to live inside the page's animation-frame callback, and all of
// it is on this side of the line the two files are split along - a timestamp
// arrives from the browser and pixels and samples leave for it, but between
// those two the arithmetic is a fixed-timestep loop that has never needed a
// browser to be right or wrong. Being unreachable without one is what left it
// checked by nothing: the page's scheduling is executed by no case in the suite,
// so the clamp, the cap and the drop were three rules stated only in comments.
// `web_player_steps_on_the_accumulators_clock` is what reads them now.
//
// A CLOCK rather than a loop, because the loop is the caller's: something arms
// an animation frame, hands what it is given to `advance` below, and does what
// the answer says. What this owns is the BOUNDARY - the instant the next step
// stands at - and `Input` above says why that is the whole job: the queue is
// drained by a boundary and a boundary is a step, so a clock that advances
// boundaries is a clock that steps the game.
//
// The session is reached through a function rather than held, which is
// `watchStore`'s move for `watchStore`'s reason: a reset builds a new session
// under a page that goes on running, and a clock closed over the retired one
// would step a game nobody is playing and render samples out of a linear memory
// nothing is listening to. What deliberately does NOT come back new across that
// swap is the accumulator - a reset is not a stall, and nothing was owed to it.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// WHOSE ANIMATION FRAME DRIVES THIS, which used to be a constant with two
// values and is now a fact about where the game is stepped.
//
// The page used to post every animation-frame timestamp to the worker, take the
// state back and paint it on its NEXT callback - postback, which cost a whole
// display frame because the answer arrived after the callback that asked had
// returned. Beside it stood a phase-locked shape: a timer in the worker, aimed
// a few milliseconds before where the next vsync was estimated to fall. It was
// never shipped, because the estimate is a model and a model that aimed low
// missed the callback by a whole frame - `madhousearcade`'s
// `docs/runs/threaded-host-run.md` at `3f4fdb8d`, section (e), measured press
// to next vsync at p50 23.5 ms on the single-threaded loop, 39.9 posting the
// timestamps, and 27.8 phase-locked with a p90 of 48.5 against postback's 47.6.
//
// THOSE THREE MEDIANS DO NOT PRICE THE THREE SHAPES AGAINST EACH OTHER, and
// `madhousearcade`'s `docs/decisions.md`, item 55, is what struck them. One run
// of a shape carries a per-run constant of up to four frames - the instant the
// queue below was drained to settled in the run's first moments and was then
// held - so one sample of each shape is three samples of one distribution. What
// survives is the comparison made INSIDE a run: a constant offset moves a run's
// p50 and its p90 together, so the gap between them is the phase estimate's own
// bimodality and the reason this shape was not shipped is unaffected.
//
// THE PAGE READS THE DISPLAY AND THE WORKER STEPS ON WHAT IT POSTS, which is
// neither of those two shapes and takes the best half of each. `player.html`'s
// `loop` arms itself and posts its own animation-frame timestamp, and
// `sim.worker.js` runs this clock on the number it is handed and publishes what
// the tick produced. There is nothing to estimate, because the timestamp is a
// real callback's; and the round trip costs nothing, because the page posts and
// carries on - what comes back is the heartbeat the watchdog below was reading
// anyway, and no callback here ever waits for it.
//
// IT WAS THE WORKER'S OWN ANIMATION FRAME UNTIL 2026-09-28, on a sentence this
// block carried: a `requestAnimationFrame` callback inside the worker IS the
// vsync. It is not, in Safari, and the whole of this clock was placed on it.
// `madhousearcade`'s `docs/runs/drawing-worker-run.md` read p50 16.7 ms over
// 301 samples in Chrome 152 and p50 17 over 288 in Safari 26.6.2 and took both
// for the display's own cadence; Safari quantizes animation-frame timestamps to
// 1 ms, so the second median fits anything from 16.5 to 17.5, and a RATE was
// never the question. The PHASE is: section 8 of `madhousearcade`'s
// `docs/runs/frame-cadence-run.md` put a Safari worker's callbacks at a
// circular concentration of 0.147 round the refresh period against a uniform
// null of 0.097, where Chrome's worker reads 0.985. A thread asked sixty times
// a second still cannot be smooth while its callbacks land at a drifting phase,
// and no rule on that thread can correct it. Section 19 of the same log is why
// `step` stayed on a thread of its own even so: a wedged one is a thread the
// page can end, and nothing could report a page that wedged itself.
//
// What that log records and this change leaves alone. The display is NOT the
// simulation's rate - it read 120 Hz in one reading and 60 Hz in another on one
// panel - so a frame callback owes whatever `advance` below says it owes and
// often nothing. And a hidden tab stops an animation frame dead in Chrome while
// leaving a timer unthrottled, which is why the halt that stops the page
// posting is load bearing rather than tidy. The picture is still RENDERED a
// thread further out, the display frame `madhousearcade`'s
// `docs/archived/render-worker-plan.md` paid; the CANVAS came back to the page
// the day after this phase landed so the commit lands on the display's own
// callback too, by `madhousearcade`'s `docs/archived/page-commit-plan.md`.

// THE RULE THIS FILE USED TO CARRY ASKED THE WRONG QUESTION, and the whole of
// the section below is the answer to the right one.
//
// It asked "how long since last time", got 16, 17, 16, 18, 17, 15 where the
// truth is 16.667, and owed a step at exactly 16.667 - so a reading of 16 fell
// just short, nothing moved, and the leftover made the next callback step
// twice. Rounding each interval to what the display MEANT to deliver and
// carrying the rounding error fixed the worst of that and is still the wrong
// shape: it consults a measurement that wobbles by a millisecond, sixty times a
// second, and acts on every wobble. On a display measured at exactly 60.000 Hz
// against the window server, with Safari's page delivering 2,391 callbacks
// where 2,400 were due, it turned that stream into 57 crooked commits in 40
// seconds where the browser's own bursts and stalls set a floor of about 9.
// `madhousearcade`'s `docs/runs/frame-cadence-run.md` at `3f4fdb8d`, sections
// 10 to 12, are the readings, and its `docs/frame-clock-plan.md` is the design.
//
// TRUST THE RATE, RECONCILE RARELY. Decide once how many steps a callback is
// worth, count callbacks, and consult the wall clock only when the accumulated
// difference has grown past a deadband. Three pieces, and the division of
// labour between them is the point:
//
//   - `refreshRate` below reads a rolling estimate of the thread's own rate and
//     maps it to a plausible refresh rate. A CHOICE rather than a number, so
//     ordinary noise can never move it and a real change moves it decisively.
//   - `Clock.advance` then advances by a CONSTANT amount per callback - one
//     step per callback at 60 Hz, one per two at 120, five per twelve at 144 -
//     so stepping is regular by construction and the interval's jitter never
//     reaches it at all.
//   - And the NET deficit is reconciled past a deadband: the wall clock says
//     the run owes so many steps, it has taken so many, and while the
//     difference is inside the band nothing happens. Past it, one extra step or
//     one skipped, and never a correction derived from a single interval.
//
// THE RECONCILIATION IS ALWAYS RIGHT AND THE ESTIMATE ONLY MAKES THE MOTION
// SMOOTH. That is the sentence to keep: a perfect estimate leaves the
// reconciliation nothing to do, and a stale or wrong one - the second after a
// display changes - makes the motion briefly rough and cannot make the game run
// at the wrong speed. Which is why the estimate is allowed to be a rolling
// median over a second rather than something clever, and why nothing below
// treats it as authority.
//
// STEPS A SECOND IS A GATE ON THIS RULE AND NEVER A DIAGNOSTIC. Three rules in
// the investigation that produced this one looked perfect by getting the rate
// wrong - rounding without carrying the drift, rounding only to whole frames,
// and one step per callback with no correction at all, which posts ZERO crooked
// commits by running the game 0.43% slow. `Game_Audio_Block` is 800 samples a
// step against a 48 kHz device, so that last one is a 208-sample shortfall a
// second and a queue of 2,400 drained in eleven. A rule that smooths by running
// the game slow is a failure whatever else it posts.

// The rates a thread that the display drives is allowed to be read as.
//
// A small closed set rather than the measurement itself, because the value of
// snapping is EXACTNESS: at a chosen 60 against a contract of 60 a callback is
// worth exactly one step, the credit below lands exactly on its boundary, and
// there is no residue left for jitter to turn into motion. A measurement of
// 59.94 would leave a thousandth of a step a frame, which is the same defect
// one decimal place further down.

//

// remainder; the queue drains to the simulated boundary; so the band costs 50
// ms of input latency and nothing else, and 17 ms more than a band of two,
// worst case. The lag is real and is still what this constant buys. The rest
// was not a worst case - the boundary settled at a level in a run's first
// moments and then HELD it, so it was a toll every press of that run paid, and
// a reload was the only thing that re-rolled it. Item 55 of `madhousearcade`'s
// `docs/decisions.md` at `3f4fdb8d` and its `docs/runs/input-boundary-run.md`
// are the measurement. A stall is the exception and is bounded by the two
// numbers rather than by this one: the lag it opens is paid back a step a
// callback, and anything over `BACKLOG` is dropped instead.
//
// AND THE INPUT HALF OF IT IS NOT PAID AT ALL NOW, which is why THREE above no
// longer names a latency it gives up rather than naming a corrected one.
// `advance` below drains the last step of a callback's burst to the callback's
// own instant, so the band's width no longer reaches the step a player feels
// whatever it is set to: `products/web-player/tests/loop.js` sweeps 60, 120,
// 144, 90, 30 and 57.8 Hz and a first-second stall of every size from 0 to 64
// ms, and reads the boundary level with the callback on every one of them. The
// earlier steps of a burst still drain to earlier instants, because they
// simulate earlier time and a key handed to one of them is back-dated onto a
// step that ran before the hand moved.
//
// What the band also costs is the RESOLUTION of a reading. A deficit standing
// anywhere in it is up to three steps not yet taken, so steps a second measured
// over a 40 s window cannot be pinned tighter than about 0.075 however right the
// rule is - which is the gate exactly, and is why the cases that
// measure the rate run longer streams than the ones that measure the cadence.
//
// `BACKLOG` is eight because the step cap is eight: a callback will not run more
// steps than that, so a deficit larger than it cannot be paid off inside one
// callback however far behind the run has fallen, and a run paying off eight
// frames at one a callback is already 133 ms of hands-ahead-of-game.

// The watchdog: a simulation that has stopped answering, named and stopped.
//
// Item 10 of `madhousearcade`'s `docs/decisions.md`, paid one milestone ago: "A
// watchdog for the web player. The mechanism is measured; the cost is moving
// the frame loop into a worker. It need not exfiltrate state - a hung page can
// report the frame and the input log it already records for Mark, and
// `inspector dump --replay ... --budget` reconstructs everything natively."
//
// A `step` that never returns used to wedge the page with nothing able to say
// so: the loop, the listeners, the canvas and the game were one thread, and the
// thread that would have to notice was the thread that was gone. The simulation
// is a worker now, so the page is awake while the game is not - and a worker is
// a thing the page can end.
//
// WHAT IT WATCHES is a HEARTBEAT read on the page's own clock. The page posts
// one `tick` per animation frame and the worker answers each one with a frame
// message, whether or not that instant owed a step; this rule stamps each
// callback as the oldest instant nothing has been heard since, and a frame
// message clears it. So the question "is the simulation still there" is "has
// anything come back since the oldest tick I posted", which needs no clock but
// the page's own animation frame.
//
// IT IS A ROUND TRIP AGAIN, AND THE ARITHMETIC HAS NEVER CHANGED THROUGH THREE
// SHAPES. The page posted a timestamp per frame and the worker answered each
// one; then the worker asked the display for its own frames and this rule read a
// heartbeat it was sending anyway; and now the page posts the timestamp again,
// because a worker's animation frame is not the display's in Safari and the
// block above `class Clock` carries that reading. Nothing here waits on an
// answer - `loop` posts and reads and blocks on neither - so the round trip
// costs this rule exactly what the free heartbeat cost it.
//
// ARMED BY THE FIRST ANSWER, never before it. A worker that has not answered
// yet is a worker still compiling the module, laying down an arena and running
// `construct`, or - under node, where the shim fetches `player.js` over HTTP
// before the file even evaluates - not yet running at all. None of that is a
// hang and all of it is unbounded, so the budget below would be a guess about a
// network rather than a reading of a game. What that costs is stated rather
// than hidden: a `construct` that never returns is OUTSIDE this watchdog, and
// it is the only thing left that is.
//
// A `render_video` THAT NEVER RETURNS IS NOT THIS WATCHDOG'S ANY MORE, and
// that is the whole of what moving the picture onto a thread of its own did to
// this file. It was outside the watchdog while the page drew, for a structural
// reason rather than an omission - the thread that would have had to report the
// hang was the thread it wedged - and inside it for as long as the simulation
// drew. The renderer is a third thread now with a heartbeat of its own, so a
// picture that never comes back stops THAT heartbeat and this one goes on
// arriving. `RenderWatch` below is the rule that reads it, and the difference
// between the two is what each one means: a simulation that stops answering is
// the run ending, and a renderer that stops answering is a renderer replaced.
//
// DISARMED BY EVERY HALT, and that is a reading rather than a courtesy.
// `madhousearcade`'s `docs/runs/threaded-host-run.md` (b) measured a worker's
// timer in a BACKGROUND tab at p99.9 766 ms between ticks and a worst gap of
// 1,584 ms, against 25.6 ms at p99.9 with the tab in front. A watchdog left
// armed through `hidden` would report a hang every few seconds on a tab nobody
// is looking at, terminate the run and lose it. A halt stops the page's own
// frame loop, which is both halves in one move: no tick is posted, so the
// worker owes no answer, and the pending instant is forgotten with the loop
// that stamped it. `madhousearcade`'s `docs/runs/drawing-worker-run.md` (b) is
// why the halt reaches the worker at all rather than being left implicit in the
// silence - Chrome stops a hidden tab's worker animation frame outright and
// Safari throttles it to about nine ticks a second, so a clock left running
// there would read the browser rather than the game, and `prime` puts it back.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// How long the page waits for an answer before it decides there will not be
// one. Fixed, and not adaptive: a watchdog whose budget follows the machine is a
// watchdog that grows one on the machine it is meant to report.

// WHAT IT TOLERATES. A frame is 16.667 ms and one animation frame owes at most
// eight steps, so an ordinary tick is one to eight steps, one picture and a
// message out. `madhousearcade`'s `docs/decisions.md` measures the whole of a
// game natively at under ~72 µs a frame - `step` ~2.2 µs, `render_audio` ~20,
// `render_video` 5 to 50 - so eight steps is well under a millisecond of
// arithmetic, and this budget is about fourteen thousand times the worst frame
// anybody here has measured. The picture is not on this path: `render_video`
// runs on the render worker, which `RenderWatch` below watches by the same
// budget, and the page draws. It is also sixty display frames, and
// `madhousearcade`'s `docs/runs/threaded-host-run.md` (b) puts a visible
// worker's worst gap at 26.1 ms over 3,598 samples on a machine at a one-minute
// load of 24. A body spawning is not on this path either: six `new Worker`
// calls on the simulation's own thread are 22-23 µs each in a browser, measured
// in `madhousearcade`'s `docs/decisions.md`, and the body runs somewhere else.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT TOLERATE is a step that legitimately takes over a second,
// and nothing in this tree writes one. `madhousearcade`'s `games/drop-four`
// came closest and is why the sentence is worth writing down: it thinks with a
// minimax search, spends a bounded number of nodes per frame and carries its
// stack in the state block precisely so that the frame rate is safe on every
// machine. A game that wanted a second of arithmetic per step would have to be
// resumable in that same way, since a 60 Hz console cannot show it anyway.
//
// It is `inspector --budget`'s own number, deliberately: the report below names
// the command that reproduces the hang natively, and a page that reported a
// stall the native watchdog then declined to see would be two watchdogs
// disagreeing about one game.

// The renderer's own watchdog: a picture that never came back.
//
// THE SAME ARITHMETIC AND A DIFFERENT VERDICT, which is the whole reason this
// is a class beside `Watchdog` rather than a second instance of it. A
// simulation that stops answering is the run ending and there is nothing else
// to do about it; a renderer that stops answering is a thread holding an
// instance of a module and nothing a player can see, and the page can end it and
// build another while the game plays on - going on committing the last picture
// it was sent throughout, because the canvas is the page's. That is what
// `madhousearcade`'s `docs/archived/render-worker-plan.md` at `3f4fdb8d` bought
// with a display frame of latency, and this is the half of it the page owns.
//
// IT COUNTS ONLY WHILE A PICTURE IS OWED, and that is the one rule `Watchdog`
// does not have. The simulation publishes on a tick that stepped and did not
// claim `game_report_still`, so a resting game, a game whose pixels have not
// moved and a halted page all publish nothing - and a renderer that has drawn
// nothing because nothing was posted to it is idle rather than wedged. So the
// question this asks is not "has anything come back" but "is the newest picture
// the simulation published still uncommitted", which is two frame numbers and
// their difference. A renderer merely BEHIND is not wedged either: every commit
// of a new picture clears the wait, so what has to happen for this to fire is a
// whole budget in which a published picture never reached the canvas.
//
// WHAT IT READS IS THE COMMIT rather than a claim from the thread it is
// watching, which is what moving the canvas back to the page bought it for
// nothing. `drew` used to be a message the renderer posted after writing its own
// canvas; `commitPicture` in `player.html` calls it at the instant the page
// first draws a new list, so the number here is a picture on a screen rather
// than a list handed to it by another thread. A re-commit of a picture
// already committed says nothing, for this rule's own reason: it would clear a
// wait the renderer still owes.
//
// ARMED BY THE RENDERER SAYING IT IS OPEN, which is `render.worker.js`'s
// `ready` and the one place this differs from the watchdog above. That one arms
// on its first ANSWER, because a simulation answers every display frame whether
// or not it stepped; a renderer sends nothing until it has rendered, and the
// subject this exists to catch is a renderer that never renders once - so an
// arming rule that waited for a picture would be a rule that never fires on the
// only case that matters. `ready` is posted when the instance is compiled and
// the channel is being listened to, so everything before it - the worker's own
// fetch, its `importScripts`, the compile - is outside this exactly as a
// `construct` is outside the other.
//
// ONE REPLACEMENT PER SESSION, and `replaced` is where that is remembered
// rather than in the page, because it is a fact about the run and the page
// already throws this away on a reset. A renderer that hangs twice is a game
// that hangs, and an unbounded loop would hide it; the second stall ends the
// run through the same `seize` a simulation's does, saying
// `renderStallLine` instead.

    // is not meant to - both mean there is nothing here to check against. So a
    // recording taken here replays and verifies nothing about its resources,
    // which is exactly what the page could say about them before.

    // The pointer is here for the first reason and is written as a change, like

// which is how the defect was found: 700 CSS px of room at 100% gives scale 2
// and a 480 px canvas, and the same window at 50% reports 1400 CSS px, takes
// scale 5, and draws a 1200 px canvas half again as large again. Zooming out
// made the game bigger, in irregular jumps, because a floor moves in steps.
//
// Counting device pixels is strictly sharper, and that half is not in doubt:
// whole CSS pixels restricted the count to multiples of `devicePixelRatio` for
// no reason at all, so a 390 CSS px phone at 3 dppx took 1, three device pixels
// to a console pixel, where 4 fits and 320 CSS px is both larger and crisper
// than the 240 it was drawing.
//
// It did NOT fix the zoom, and that is measured rather than argued: Safari at
// 1.5 dppx, zoomed out, still grew the canvas and still reported the same
// ratio. No unit could have fixed it, because the defect is the refit and not
// the arithmetic - `layoutChange` below is what keeps a zoom from reaching this
// function at all.
//
// AND KEEPING THE ZOOM OUT OF HERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EITHER, which is the third
// pass over this and the one the numbers finally explain. Declining to refit is
// what lets a zoom shrink the game; it does nothing about the fit that DOES
// run, and a reload runs one. Measured in the browser, on one window at two
// zooms - the reading is in `tests/layout.js` as the fixture:
//
//     100%      inner 1268x1320   dpr 2   outer 1268x1410
//     zoomed out  inner 2536x2640   dpr 1   outer 1268x1410
//
// `inner` doubles and `dpr` halves, so `inner * dpr` - the device pixels this
// function counts - is IDENTICAL at both. The fit was already zoom-invariant,
// which sounds like the goal and is the defect: it means the canvas comes out
// the same PHYSICAL size at every zoom and fills the window at every zoom. A
// player who zooms out and reloads is back where they started, and one who is
// zoomed out as far as the browser goes has nothing left to try.
//
// So the zoom is divided back out, and `outer` is what measures it: it is the
// window in screen coordinates and page zoom does not move it, so `outer /
// inner` is exactly the zoom factor - 1268/1268 = 1 at 100%, 1268/2536 = 0.5
// zoomed out. Folding it in makes the CSS BOX invariant instead of the physical
// size, which is what browser zoom does to everything else on a page: the box
// above stays 1200 css px at both zooms, and the zoomed-out one renders at 1200
// device pixels where the other renders at 2400.
//
// The whole-multiple guarantee survives it, which is the thing that could not
// be given up: the scale is still a whole number and the box is still `240 *
// scale` device pixels. It is a SMALLER whole number when zoomed out - 5 where
// 100% takes 10 - and that is the game being drawn smaller, not less sharply.
//
// What a whole multiple guarantees is therefore worth stating exactly, because
// it is less than it sounds. At rest it is exact: the CSS box times the ratio
// is `240 * scale` device pixels, so every console pixel is a square block of
// them. While the page is zoomed it is approximate, because a CSS pixel then
// covers a number of device pixels this file cannot read. And on a fractional
// ratio it was never exact BEFORE this work either - whole multiples in CSS
// space are not whole multiples on the grid that exists, so at the 1.5 dppx the
// probe was run on, the old code's CSS scale 3 was 4.5 device pixels to a
// console pixel and some columns were already a device pixel wider than their
// neighbours. The rule reads as inviolable and has been approximate on that
// display for as long as it has been written down.
//
// AND IT IS NO LONGER UNCONDITIONAL, which is the fourth pass and the one that
// gave something up on purpose. What a whole multiple costs is the remainder,
// and on a phone the remainder is most of what a phone has: the window is 240
// times four-and-a-fraction, so the fraction is a big share of a small screen
// and there is no second window to move to. The readings that decided it, each
// device's own viewport through this function - waste is what the whole
// multiple leaves unused, uneven is how much wider a console pixel is than its
// neighbour once the remainder is spent instead:
//
//     iPhone SE          375 css   whole 360    waste  4%   uneven 33%
//     iPhone 15 / 16     393 css   whole 320    waste 19%   uneven 25%
//     iPhone 15 Pro Max  430 css   whole 400    waste  7%   uneven 20%
//     iPad mini          744 css   whole 720    waste  3%   uneven 17%
//     iPad 10.9          820 css   whole 720    waste 12%   uneven 17%
//     1x desktop        1000 css   whole 480    waste 27%   uneven 50%
//
// So the fit fills the span exactly - a fractional scale, and console pixels a
// device pixel apart in width - unless a device pixel is one somebody can see,
// where it takes the whole multiple under it as it always did. That is the
// whole rule, and the threshold in it is a physical claim rather than a taste:
// at 2x and 3x the odd column is a twentieth of a millimetre wider than the one
// beside it, and at 1x it is a whole monitor pixel, which is the 50% row above
// and is the ordinary way to visit a site.
//
// `ratio / zoom` rather than the ratio alone, because `devicePixelRatio` counts
// the browser's zoom into itself: a 1x monitor at 200% reports 2 and is still a
// 1x monitor.
//
// TWO REJECTED SHAPES, because both are the obvious one from somewhere.
//
// A threshold on DENSITY IN CONSOLE PIXELS - fill where there are enough device
// pixels per console pixel to hide the difference - is exactly backwards, and
// it is the intuitive rule: that density is LOWEST on the small screens, 4.9 on
// an iPhone against 8.5 on an iPad Pro, so it would have filled the screens
// with room to spare and snapped the ones without.
//
// And a SECOND CONDITION ON THE WASTE, filling only where the whole multiple
// leaves at least a twentieth of the span, was written and then taken out. It
// is defensible - it spares the iPhone SE a trade of the worst unevenness on
// the list for 15 css px - but it buys that on two devices at the price of a
// threshold, a constant and a branch in every case that reads this, and the
// rule stops being a sentence.

// padding inside a 1px border. Half of a fractional leftover is a quarter of a
// CSS pixel, which at a ratio of 2 is half a device pixel, so the canvas lands
// straddling a row of the grid. The browser resolves that by blending the top
// row of the game with what is behind the canvas, and the edge goes soft.
//
// THE DARK LINE THIS WAS WRITTEN AGAINST WAS NOT THIS, and it outlived the
// correction. What showed was the canvas's own black background, which the
// browser paints to a different rect from the picture wherever an edge is off
// the grid - and a snap cannot put an edge on the grid after a zoom, which
// never refits, or on the far side of a box the fill left fractional. So the
// background went instead, and `#screen` in `player.html` holds the readings.

// Chrome already puts a canvas on whole device pixels when it paints, so at 1x
// this correction moves the picture a whole pixel off the rect it reports.
//
// A reading rather than an even number of pixels of chrome, which was the other
// way to fix it. Rounding the row to 30px puts the artefact away at a ratio of
// 2 and leaves it at 1.5, where a leftover of half a CSS pixel is three
// quarters of a device one however the chrome is sized; and it would put the
// arithmetic in the hands of every future edit to a button's padding. This is
// the same correction whatever the ratio, the window and the row add up to.
//
// Rounding to the nearest whole device pixel rather than flooring, because the
// correction is then at most half a device pixel either way. Flooring moves the
// box by up to a whole one, and always in the same direction, which can push it

//
// `outerWidth` is the window in screen coordinates and page zoom does not move
// it, where `innerWidth` is CSS pixels and does - so the two divide to exactly
// the zoom. Width rather than height because the browser's own chrome is above
// the page rather than beside it: `outerHeight` carries a tab strip and an
// address bar that `outerWidth` does not, and a docked console takes
// `innerHeight` without touching outer at all.
//
// ALL OF WHICH ASSUMES THE OUTER PAIR IS A WINDOW, and on a phone it is the
// SCREEN. Measured on an iPhone, through this page, by rotating it:
//
//     portrait    inner 390x699    outer 390x844
//     landscape   inner 750x284    outer 390x844
//
// The outer pair does not turn over, because the device has one screen and it
// has one size. Portrait survives that by luck - 390/390 is 1, which is the
// right answer - and landscape reads 390/750 = 0.52, so the page concluded the
// player had zoomed the browser out to half and divided it back out of the fit,
// drawing a 125 css px canvas where 240 fits. That is the whole of the "the
// zoom is weird after rotating" report.
//
// So the reading is refused when the two pairs disagree about which way up the
// window is, because a window's chrome adds to it and cannot turn it over: a
// portrait outer around a landscape inner is not this window at all, and a
// phone that has no page zoom in the first place is right to answer 1.
//
// The failure mode, which is a narrow band rather than a class: a desktop
// window whose inner box is barely wider than it is tall has an outer box that
// chrome makes taller than it is wide, so the pairs disagree and a zoom there
// reads as 1. What that costs is a fit performed WHILE zoomed in such a window
// - a reload or a resize - which fills rather than dividing the zoom out. It
// cannot be told apart from the phone by these four numbers, and the phone is
// the case that is wrong on every rotation rather than in a band.
// What the page reads of its window, given the browser's globals and whether
// the page is EMBEDDED in another one.
//
// Everything above about the outer pair assumes it is this page's window, and
// in a frame it is not: `outerWidth` is the browser window around the page
// that embeds this one, while `innerWidth` is the frame. 4x4's tuner, which
// shows the player in a 418 px frame beside its sliders, read a 1000 by 1300
// window over it as a zoom of 2.4, multiplied the fit by it and drew a 936 by
// 1664 canvas that showed only its top left corner. A window wider than it is
// tall hid it, since the refusal above reads a frame turned the other way as 1. The same mix-up made a resized
// frame read as a zoom and never refit.
//
// So an embedded page reads its frame as its window. A zoom it can then not
// see, since a browser zooms the frame and its outer box together; what that
// costs is a fit that fills the frame while the embedding page is zoomed, which
// is what a frame is for. A resized frame moves both pairs, so it reads as a
// window change and refits.

// density; `zoom`, the player working the browser's own control; or `none`.
//
// This exists because the page had no way to tell those apart and refitted on
// all of them, which is the whole of the defect above. A zoom is the player
// SAYING how large they want the game, and a refit is the page overruling them
// half a frame later - so zooming out handed the page more CSS pixels, the fit
// took a bigger multiple, and the game grew. Answering "the player has no
// control" turns out to need no control at all: it needs the page to stop
// taking it away, and then Cmd-minus does what it does on every other page.
//
// `outerWidth` and `outerHeight` are the discriminator. They are the window in
// screen coordinates and page zoom does not move them, where `innerWidth` and
// `innerHeight` are CSS pixels and it does. So inner moving alone is a zoom,
// and that is the case that must NOT refit.
//
// `display` is separate from `window` because it is the one ratio change that
// still has to refit. A window dragged to a monitor of another density keeps
// its CSS size, so the inner dimensions hold still while the ratio moves - and
// the CSS box that was a whole number of device pixels on the old screen is not
// one on the new. Zoom is excluded from it by the same test read the other way:
// Chrome moves the ratio when zooming AND moves the inner dimensions with it,
// so requiring the inner dimensions to hold still keeps a Chrome zoom out of
// here. Safari does not move the ratio at all - measured, `10x at 1.5 dppx`
// unchanged across a zoom - so there it never fires either way.
//
// The failure mode is worth knowing before trusting it: if some browser moves
// the outer dimensions under zoom, that zoom reads as a resize and refits, and
// the behaviour there is exactly what this replaced rather than something new
// and worse.

// dark background, and a game declaring a pale surround would have left the HUD
// reading light grey on cream - unreadable, on a page whose whole job is to say
// what the module is.
//
// So there is one formula and it takes one decision: which direction contrast
// lies in. Every other colour is the surround mixed that far toward black or
// toward white, which keeps the page one family with the game rather than a
// dark frame around it, and keeps every pair legible by construction rather
// than by a table someone has to re-check when a game is added.
//
// Here rather than in the stylesheet, though `color-mix()` would express it in
// CSS, because this half of the player runs under node with no browser at all -

// against `inspector info`, rather than a computed style only a person can see.

// pause indicator nobody can see. The reason is that contrast against a
// mid-tone is bounded - about 5.3 either way - so a fraction that is generous
// against near-black is nowhere near enough there.
//
// So a text colour is pushed further until it clears the bar, in twentieths,
// and takes full contrast if even that will not do. The step from `base` is
